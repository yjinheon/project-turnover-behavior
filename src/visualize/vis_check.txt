+ Classification Report: A visual classification report that displays precision, recall, and F1 per-class as a heatmap.
  + Confusion Matrix: A heatmap view of the confusion matrix of pairs of classes in multi-class classification.
  + ROCAUC: Graphs the receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve.
  + Precision-Recall Curves: Plots the precision and recall for different probability thresholds.
  + Class Balance: Visual inspection of the target to show the support of each class to the final estimator.
  + Class Prediction Error: An alternative to the confusion matrix that shows both support and the difference between actual and predicted classes.
  + Discrimination Threshold: Shows precision, recall, f1, and queue rate over all thresholds for binary classifiers that use a discrimination probability or score.
